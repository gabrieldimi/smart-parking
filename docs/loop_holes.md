- Alpr doesn't care about depth. Any object (be it a photo, poster or a signpost etc.) with a license plate number written on it will be     recognized and in that way, it doesn't have to necessarily be a car standing in front of the ultrasonic sensor.
- If car is changed quick enough, the newly parked one will not be analyzed
